A few months ago I started a book club focused on giving newbies like myself a space to read books to help us develop and share experiences as they related to the readings. When I started this I didn't fully realize what I was doing, or how much I would get out of it, but I feel that I'm not only a better developer for it, but also a better person.

My fellow book clubbers often come to meetings with insights and experiences that open my eyes and push me to question my own opinions. Our current book, Apprenticeship Patterns by David H. Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, has provided a great base for discussions. In fact,  the last book club meeting led me to create this blog and write this post! [Megan](https://twitter.com/megandtiu) and I were discussing part of Chapter 5, specifically Record What You Learn and Share What You Learn. We talked about how we really wanted to record and share what our experiences are but there was always some challenge, internal or external, that prevented us from doing it. So, we decided to make a pact. A Blog Buddy pact, where we hold each other accountable for one blog post per week detailing what we've learned that week.

So here it is. The first blog post that will be the foundation of many more posts to come. 

Thanks for reading! :)
