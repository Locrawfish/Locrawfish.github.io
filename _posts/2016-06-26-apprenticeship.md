As some of you reading may know, before becoming a full time web developer (which happened quite recently I may add) I was an apprentice for Manhiem's Technology Apprenticeship Pilot Program in Atlanta. This meant that for three whole months I was paid to learn, practice my coding skills, and pick the brains of some very talented programmers. I sincerely believe that starting my career first as an apprentice, and **not** a junior dev, has served me and will continue to serve me well into the future.  

As I went through my apprenticeship, my mentor, the other apprentice, and myself faced challenges, and we started having conversations about what the ingredients are for a successful apprentice/mentor relationship. I would argue that there are a lot of ingredients that help to make a successful apprentice/mentor relationship, but the most important ingredient from my experience was the capacity to be vulnerable. 

## Secret Ingredient: Vulnerability
Last month at RailsConf this idea of vulnerability as a key ingredient to successful a apprenticship was rolling around in my head, so I decided to do a lightning talk on it. Unfortunately, I did not get to actually do my lightning talk due to time constraints, but my hypothesis was bolstered up by one of the [keynotes](http://www.slideshare.net/Chanelle7/rails-conference-presentation-2016-ux-rails-and-awesomeness). 

[Chanelle Henry's](https://twitter.com/Chanelle777) keynote was very personal and open. She was authentic, and for that I applaud her. Most important to my point, though, is she talked about vulnerability. Right on her slide deck she put up one of my favorite quotes by Brene Brown in big letters:

># "Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change."

###### **Sidenote:** I'm a big fan of Brene Brown and her Ted Talk, [The Power of Vulnerability](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en) is certainly something worth watching. :) 

Chanelle went on to talk about what defeats us and the fact that, generally, everyone is winging it, too, so don't beat yourself up. Her openness about vulnerability rung in my ears, though, and I haven't shaken it since.   

## Why do I think vulnerability is important?
Experience. Everytime I sit down to pair, or create a PR, or ask a question, or when my mentor pushed me, or I have to admit that I simply did not know something--I have to be vulnerable. 

I argue that vulnerability is important because:

### A space that allows vulnerability is also a space for sustained learning and growth.  


## Caveats--Oh yes, there are caveats
I say all of this knowing that not everyone has the luxury of an apprenticeship. Indeed, Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye note in [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html):

>"Real-world apprentices have to scratch and claw their way into the lives of master craftsmen and are grateful for whatever attention they can get, particularly face-to-face or, better yet, side-by-side."

And this is certainly true. I understand whole heartedly that I was lucky to have a formal apprenticeship and have a mentor that I could be vulnerable with. Some of you reading may not be in a position where you feel safe to be vulnerable with your colleagues, which sucks, because it's such a missed opportunity for everyone.

## Final Thoughts
Vulnerability is not always comfortable, and by no means the only ingredient to being a "successful" apprentice or developer, but I think that it is a hugely undervalued aspect to being an apprentice, becoming a journeyman, and growing into a craftsman.
